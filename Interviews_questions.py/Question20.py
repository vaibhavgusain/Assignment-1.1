# What is JSON? Describe in brief how youâ€™d convert JSON data into Python data?

#Answer--> JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a highly popular data format, and it stores data into NoSQL databases. JSON is generally built on the following two structures:

# A collection of <name,value> pairs
# An ordered list of values.
# Python supports JSON parsers. In fact, JSON-based data is internally represented as a dictionary in Python. To convert JSON data into Python data, we use the load() function from the JSON module.
