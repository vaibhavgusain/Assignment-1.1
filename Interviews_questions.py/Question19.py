# Differentiate between split(), sub(), and subn() methods of the remodule.

# Answer --> The re module is what we have for processing regular expressions with Python. Letâ€™s talk about the three methods we mentioned-

# split()- This makes use of a regex pattern to split a string into a list
# sub()- This looks for all substrings where the regex pattern matches, and replaces them with a different string
# subn()- Like sub(), this returns the new string and the number of replacements made
